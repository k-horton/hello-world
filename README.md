# hello-world
My first ever GitHub repository!

Hey there!
My name is Kimberly, and I didn't even last a full semester as a music major before I caved to the wonderful professors of my university's CS department. 
I'm currently studying Computer Science with a self-crafted emphasis on CyberSecurity, and I couldn't be happier!
I'm loving teaching myself about Android app development and working with object-oriented languages, especially Java.
